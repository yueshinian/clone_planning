## Gradient-Informed Path Smoothing for Wheeled Mobile Robots (GRIPS)
C++ implementation of a post-smoothing approach that improves the quality of paths generated by sampling-based planners.

> Planning smooth trajectories is important for the safe, efficient and
> comfortable operation of mobile robots, such as wheeled robots moving in
> crowded environments or cars moving at high speed. Asymptotically optimal
> sampling-based motion planners can be used to generate such trajectories
> eventually. However, to achieve the necessary efficiency for the real-time
> operation of robots, one often uses their initial feasible trajectories or the
> trajectories of non-optimal planners instead, typically after a post-smoothing
> step. We propose a gradient-informed post-smoothing algorithm, called GRIPS,
> that deforms given trajectories by locally optimizing the placement of
> vertices while satisfying the system's kinodynamic constraints.  We show
> experimentally that GRIPS typically produces trajectories of significantly
> higher smoothness and smaller length than several existing post-smoothing
> algorithms.
